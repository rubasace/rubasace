Hi there üëã

My name is Rub√©n and here you'll find some tools I've built, mainly around **CI/CD and media automation**. 

## Life @Work üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in London, currently working for [Travix International](https://www.travix.com/). My area of expertise is backend development with **Spring Boot**, **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. I'm currently in charge of our Java Framework (built on top of Spring Boot) and leading the reactive adoption using **Spring Webflux**.

I'm also starting to speak at meetups and conferences. You can check my talks so far here:

- [RSocket, the Protocol of the Future](https://www.meetup.com/Reactive-Amsterdam/events/265617612/) **Meetup** - 29 Oct 2019 (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
- [Building a chatroom with Vue.js, Java and RSocket](https://www.meetup.com/es/VigoJUG/events/267185946/) **Meetup** - 26 Dec 2019 (Vigo, Spain)
- [Building a Framework on top of Spring Boot](https://www.meetup.com/es/CorunaJUG/events/267509659/) **Meetup** - 9 Jan 2020 (A Coru√±a, Spain)
- [Building a Framework on top of Spring Boot](https://2020.springio.net/sessions/building-a-framework-on-top-of-spring-boot) at **Spring I/O Conference** - 8 Oct 2020 (Barcelona, Spain)


## Offhours

In my free time I like trying out new stuff and cover the areas I don't use that much at work, like CI/CD. 

I'm also a big fan of media content organization ([Plex](https://www.plex.tv) and [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)). Therefore, most of the projects I have here are built around that.
