Hi there üëã

My name is Rub√©n and here you'll find some tools I've built, mainly around **CI/CD and media automation**.

## Life @Work üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in Vigo (Spain), currently working remotely for [Travix International](https://www.travix.com/) London team. My area of expertise is backend development with **Spring Boot**, **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. I'm currently in charge of our Java Framework (built on top of Spring Boot) and leading the reactive adoption using **Spring Webflux**.

I'm also starting to speak at meetups and conferences. You can check my talks so far here:

## Offhours

In my free time I like trying out new stuff and cover the areas I don't use that much at work, like CI/CD. 

I'm also a big fan of media content organization ([Plex](https://www.plex.tv) and [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)). Therefore, most of the projects I have here are built around that.
